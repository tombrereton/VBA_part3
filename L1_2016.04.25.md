##VBA Part 3 25/04/2016
___

* Loading arrays into memory from a worksheet. Using the inputbox function we can load a table into memory as an array. 

```VB
'Insert code snippet
```
___

* It is good practice to write modular code in small blocks. For example, write functions that do 1 task and then call these functions in a 'control macro'

```VB
'Insert code snippet
```
___

* Use option explicit as it forces variable decleration. This is crucial for debugging and readability in large programs.

___

* Avoid declaring as a Variant if possible. This is because a variant is any type of variable (integer, string, etc), which can be computationally expensive.

___

* Avoid re-inventing the wheel (writing new code) by using inbuilt functions from VBA and worksheet.

```VB
Sub example()
'application function inputbox called
rng = Application.InputBox("Select a range", Type:=8)
'worksheet function max called
MsgBox WorksheetFunction.Max(Range("A1:A5"))
End Sub
```
___

* Use error handling to catch predicted errors and provide instructions on how to handle them. See below for an example.

```VB
Option Explicit

Sub ex5_1()

'asks user for 2 numbers
'users an error handler to catch non numeric entries

    Dim number1 As Integer, number2 As Integer
        
    On Error GoTo ErrHandler1:
        number1 = InputBox("Enter a number")
    
    On Error GoTo ErrHandler1:
        number2 = InputBox("Enter another number")
    
    MsgBox number1 + number2
    
    Exit Sub
    
'Catches type mismatch errors and returns user to enter number again
ErrHandler1:
    If Err.number = 13 Then
        MsgBox "You entered a non numeric value. Enter a number."
        Resume
    End If
    
End Sub
```
___

* Variable data types:

```VB
Integer, Long, Single, Double, Currency, Date, String, Boolean, Variant, Object
```

* 2 important concepts when dealing with variables
    * Scope - Defines which procedures can use that variable
    * Lifetime - Defines how long that variable retains the values
assigned to it
* The scope of the variable depends where it is declared:
    * In a procedure
        * It is visible only within the procedure code
    * In a module
        * It is visible only within the module code
    * In a module as Public
        * It is visible from all open workbooks
    * In a module as Private
        * It is visible only within the module code
