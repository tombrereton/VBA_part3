####Manipulation of common excel objects

* Avoid re-inventing the wheel (writing new code) by using inbuilt functions from VBA and worksheet.

```VB
Sub example()
   
   rng = Application.InputBox("Select a range", Type:=8) 'application function inputbox called
   
   MsgBox WorksheetFunction.Max(Range("A1:A5")) 'worksheet function max called
   
End Sub
```

####Variables and data types

* Variable data types:

```VB
Integer, Long, Single, Double, Currency, Date, String, Boolean, Variant, Object
```
* 2 important concepts when dealing with variables
    * Scope - Defines which procedures can use that variable
    * Lifetime - Defines how long that variable retains the values
assigned to it
* The scope of the variable depends where it is declared:
    * In a procedure
        * It is visible only within the procedure code
    * In a module
        * It is visible only within the module code
    * In a module as Public
        * It is visible from all open workbooks
    * In a module as Private
        * It is visible only within the module code

* Use option explicit as it forces variable decleration. This is crucial for debugging and readability in large programs.

* Avoid declaring as a Variant if possible. This is because a variant is any type of variable (integer, string, etc), which can be computationally expensive. Dimensionless arrays are an exception

####Arrays

* Array example code
```VB
Dim Data(5) 'Holds 6 items
Dim Data(0 to 5)
```
* Use the array function to create a short List
```VB
Dim Data as Variant
Data = Array(“North”, “South”, “East”, “West”)
```

* Find array limits with UBOUND and LBOUND
```VB
LBound(Data, 1) 'axis 1, rows
UBound(Data, 2) 'axis 2, columns
```

* When dimension of array is unknown use `Redim` to set array size once known
```VB
Dim Data() As String

Redim Data(50)
Redim Preserve Data(150)
```

* Copying from Range to Array
```VB
Sub RangeToArray()

    Dim values as Variant   'values must be variant as there is no special type for arrays
    
    Values = Range(“A1:C10”).Value 'values is a 10 x 3 array

End Sub
```

* Copying from Array to Range
```VB
Sub RangeToArray()

    Dim i as Integer, j as Integer
    Dim values as Variant
    
    values = Range(“A1:C10”).Value
    
    For i=Lbound(values, 1) To Ubound(values, 1)
        For j=Lbound(values, 2) To Ubound(values, 2)
            values(I,j) = values(I,j)*2
        Next j
    Next i
    
    Range(“A1:C10”).Value
    
End Sub
```

* Loading arrays into memory from a worksheet. Using the inputbox function we can load a table into memory as an array. 

```VB
'Insert code snippet
```

####Loops (For…Next, Do…Loop)

* Looping structures - two main types
    * `For ... Next` where you iterate for a predicted range of values.
    * `Do ... While` where you iterate until a boolean condition is met

####Subroutines and functions

* It is good practice to write modular code in small blocks. For example, write functions that do 1 task and then call these functions in a 'control macro'

```VB
'Insert code snippet
```

####Error handling

* Use error handling to catch predicted errors and provide instructions on how to handle them. See below for an example.

```VB
Option Explicit

Sub ex5_1()

'asks user for 2 numbers
'users an error handler to catch non numeric entries

    Dim number1 As Integer, number2 As Integer
        
    On Error GoTo ErrHandler1:
        number1 = InputBox("Enter a number")
    
    On Error GoTo ErrHandler1:
        number2 = InputBox("Enter another number")
    
    MsgBox number1 + number2
    
    Exit Sub
    
'Catches type mismatch errors and returns user to enter number again
ErrHandler1:
    If Err.number = 13 Then
        MsgBox "You entered a non numeric value. Enter a number."
        Resume
    End If
    
End Sub
```
